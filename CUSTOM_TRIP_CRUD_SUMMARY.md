## üîÑ Complete CRUD Workflow

### **Step 1: Customer Request Creation**
```javascript

PUT /api/custom-trips/:id
```
- Staff reviews customer request
- Assigns guide, vehicles, hotels for multiple destinations
- Sets total budget with breakdown
- Creates detailed itinerary
- Updates status to 'approved'
- Email notification sent to customer

### **Step 3: Customer Confirmation and Payment**
```javascript
POST /api/custom-trips/:id/confirm
```
- Customer reviews approved trip details
- Confirms and processes payment
- System creates Booking record
- Updates CustomTrip status to 'confirmed'
- Email confirmation sent to customer

### **Step 4: Booking Integration**
- Custom trip appears in customer's "My Bookings"
- Unified booking system shows both regular tours and custom trips
- Complete trip details accessible through booking interface
