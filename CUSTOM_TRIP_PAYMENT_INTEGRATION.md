## ðŸŽ‰ **RESULT**

Your custom trip payment system is now **fully integrated** with Stripe! Users can:

- âœ… **View approved custom trips** in "My Bookings"
- âœ… **Click "Confirm & Pay"** to proceed to payment
- âœ… **Complete secure payment** via Stripe Elements
- âœ… **Receive confirmation** via email and success page
- âœ… **Have both booking and custom trip** automatically confirmed

The error "Custom trip cannot be confirmed in current status" is now resolved - the system properly creates a booking and redirects to payment instead of trying to confirm directly.
